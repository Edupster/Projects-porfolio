# === Your task ==============================================================
# Let's have some 'fun'.
# Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence and have a brief read 
# at what a 'Garden Path sentence' is (at the top) and look at the 'Examples'

# Create the file garden.py for this task.
# 1. Use some Garden Path sentences or think up your own (at least 5).
# 2. Tokenise and perform Entity recognition for each of the sentences 
#    after you have stored them in a list called gardenpathSentences.
# 3. See how spaCy has categorised these sentences and look up the entities you
#    don't understand
# 4. At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two unusual entities 
# you found that spaCy gave one of the words of your sentences - did you expect this?
